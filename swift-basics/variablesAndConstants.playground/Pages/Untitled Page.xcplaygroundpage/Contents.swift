/*
Naming conventions:
1) No spaces
2) Use camalCasing
3) Make sure its descriptive, looking @ you "var x"
4) Don't_use_underscores,_they're_stupid.
5) You can't use the following:
    1) start w/ numbers "var 1number"
    2) no whitespace "var this is wrong"
    3) no special characters "var ¡¿qúe?!
    4) no maths symbols "var ÷*+-"
    5) no emojis. It works but you're an asshat.
